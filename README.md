# NLP-Experiments-Assignments-
The code and the whole procedure is taken from my professor Dr B.Premjith for learning purpose and completing assignments.
The original code :  https://github.com/premjithb/Natural-Language-Processing-experiments

By taking his guidance, I have used NLTK for preprocessing, Word2Vec and Doc2Vec for embedding words and sentences, and implemented RNN and CNN-LSTM architectures as an experiment.
